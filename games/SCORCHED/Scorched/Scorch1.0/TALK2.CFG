Ugh!
Aargh!
Aaagghhh!
I'm melting!
Oof..
Oh!
Eeek!
Aacch!
I hate it when that happens.
One direct hit can ruin your whole day.
Oh no!
Not me!
Ouch.
Oh no, not again.
Another one bites the dust.
Goodbye.
Help me!
Farewell, cruel world.
Remember the Alamo!
Oh man!
Dooh!
Another day, another bomb.
This is the End, my only friend.
It's all over.
The fat lady sang.
Why does everything happen to me?
I'm going down.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Crapola.
Pow!
Bif!
Bam!
Zonk!
I should've listened to my mother...
