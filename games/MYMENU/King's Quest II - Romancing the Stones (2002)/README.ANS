In AGD Interactive (formerly Tierra Entertainment)'s second chapter in the King's Quest VGA remakes, King Graham travels to the land of Kolyma to find his bride, encountering new characters and adventures along the way. He must eventually find the three mystical stones to open a gateway to his final goal.

This is more than a standard remake - the adventure enthusiasts at AGD Interactive have created an entirely new King's Quest, influenced by certain familiar elements from Roberta Williams' original Sierra AGI title. It incorporates new characters, VGA backgrounds and cutscenes, and an original MP3 score by the folks over at Quest Studios.
