This is the PC version of a little-known and poorly-rated Amiga arcade game which was released a year after. The DOS version is shorter and technically much worse. The game is made in a rather unusual manner: everything that is happening in it is presented in the form of a "movie" - at the very bottom of the screen you can see the chairs and the heads of the audience. Some of the opponents spit or throw something at the hero, but he can withstand several hits; any physical contact with them instantly leads to death (although formally Mowgli can fight with his hands). In the event of the hero's death, he is immediately reborn, but one of the spectators falls asleep from boredom - the letters “Z” appear near him. In the case of all the spectators falling asleep, the game will be lost.
