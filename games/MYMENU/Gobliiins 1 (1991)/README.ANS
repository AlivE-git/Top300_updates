A voodoo doll has turned King Angoulafre mad. You control a team of three Goblins - Oups, Ignatius and Asgard (Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo in the US release), who must find four magic components to track down Niak the Wizard, who is the only one who can put things right. They all have different skills - one can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. You switch between them to solve puzzles in this point-and-click game.

Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. The game takes in 22 landscapes, each of which has puzzles which must be cleared. Your characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.
